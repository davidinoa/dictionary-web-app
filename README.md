# Overview

This is a solution to the [Dictionary web app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/dictionary-web-app-h5wwnyuKFL)

The goal of this project was to build a responsive dictionary application that provides users with definitions, synonyms, antonyms, and audio pronunciations of searched words. The application integrates with the Free Dictionary API and employs a sleek, user-friendly interface that adapts to different device screen sizes and supports theme switching based on user preference.

The application was designed to provide a seamless user experience with robust state management and efficient data fetching strategies, ensuring that users receive immediate feedback when interacting with the app. One of the key requirements was to allow users to experience minimal loading times while maintaining consistent application state, even during network interruptions or poor connectivity.

## Features Implemented

Users of this application can:

- Search for words to find their meanings, usage, and phonetics.
- Listen to the pronunciation of words to understand their correct articulation.
- View detailed descriptions and usage examples for better comprehension.
- Enjoy a seamless experience on any device, thanks to a responsive layout.
- Experience minimal loading times and real-time interaction with dynamic content.
- Utilize the theme switcher to toggle between light and dark modes for comfortable reading, irrespective of the time of day.
- Receive visual cues and validation messages that enhance the overall usability of the form components.

## Tech Stack

The application was developed using a modern tech stack that emphasizes performance and developer experience:

- **TailwindCSS** was chosen for its utility-first approach to styling, which significantly speeds up the design process and ensures a consistent look and feel across the application.
- **Zustand** was implemented for state management to manage the application's state in a simple and efficient manner without the boilerplate that comes with other state management libraries.
- **Vite with React & TypeScript** provided a fast and efficient build setup, improving the development workflow with hot module replacement and type safety.
- **React Query** was instrumental in fetching, caching, and updating the data from the Free Dictionary API, allowing the app to keep the UI in sync with the state of the server without manual loading and syncing.

With a focus on code quality and maintainability, the application's architecture was carefully planned to allow for scalability and the easy addition of new features in the future.
